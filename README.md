# Constellation Crack

So, we need to make a puzzle. Let's get creative!

## Overview
The project will involve each team trying to decrypt a word or message.  The message is decrypted by connecting GPIO pins together.  Each GPIO pin will have a number or letter identifying it.  When the correct GPIO pins are connected in the correct order, the message will no longer be encrypted.  Each time the Pi senses a GPIO has been connected, the message will decrypt / encrypt accordingly.  The way of decrypting the message will not necessarily involve using brute-force, as each team will be given hints as time passes to solve the puzzle.  Each team will have around five minutes to decrypt the message.  The key to resolve the puzzle will be themed around constellations and will be randomized for each team.
This project will involve created a GUI to display message, hints, and time left.  The connecting of wires will involving pulling information from the GPIO pins.  The task will be complex to code and build, but is still within the knowledge of our team and can be completed by CyberStorm.
