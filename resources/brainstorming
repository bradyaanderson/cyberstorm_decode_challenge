# telescopes
# use Pi camera to find a clue
# final objective: get camera to look at something
# or, get a servo, something to rotate the camera.
# program it to rotate and look around

# IDEAS: ########
# find coordinates for camera to be located
# extract coordinates??
# pretend to have graphical interface?

# use pi to control Arduino, possibly?
# introduce some kind of conflict, such as:
# hide root access. First person to find it can lock the others out.

# there's a command to type in
# run python script to get live video
# notes around the place - they're all a puzzle
# gotta see them all                                                    # send nudes

# it could be a MARS ROVER
# that way I could use Arduino or something
# basically, the camera is on a moving rover (robot)
# and each team is trying to take control of it
# in order to find clues with the camera
# inside an enclosed space.
# that way, you have to rely on the camera to get around.
# or, each team has a rover that they're moving about.
# either way, teams can attack the other rovers and disable them
# as they try to find clues inside the dome.
# and the clues are all on pages or something.
# or, they're trying to deliver payload or spot constellations.
